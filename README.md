### Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to extract temperature data for the months of June and December and caculate the summary statistics of each month. This is to assist in determining the viability of the surf shack/ice cream shop's business model year round.

### Results

- Average June temperature is ~75 degrees
- Average December temperature is ~71 degrees
- Both months have a standard deviation greater than 3

### Summary

Temperatures on Oahu are relatively consistent year round. The high standard deviation in both months makes for a rather tight spread as well, meaning its unlikely that temperatures in June dip beneath 69 degrees, or roughly two standard deviations; 65 degrees in December. Other possibly useful queries include extracting percipitation data for each month and running another query to extract temperatures, buy only for more recent years.
